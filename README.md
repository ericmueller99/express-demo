This is a simple NodeJS API example that I am working on as sample work.  The purpose of this API will be to power a multiplayer tic-tac-toe game via Websockete
with a few simple endpoints that allow users to query/update/delete user data.

The front-end will be a ReactJS app that consumes and uses the websocks to have a real multiplayer tic-tac-toe game from multiple computers.
